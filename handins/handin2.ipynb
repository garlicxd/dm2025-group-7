    "Let's first analyse and understand what a complete graph is that when all nodes are connected with each other, meaning that the matrix L = D - A  will have it's diagonal equal to the degree, while the rest of the entries are all equal to one. The diagonal equal to the degree, given a complete graph, is n-1 (not include yourself).  Let's first look at the classic eigenvalue equation: $Lx = \\lambda{x}$. Regarding the previous proof for $\\lambda_{0} = 0$ where the eigenvector is $[111...11]^{T}$, we need a vector being orthogonal to the 1 vector in order to respect the eigenvalue equation. Orthogonality means that the dot product between our vector $[x_{1}x_{2}...x_{n}]^{T}$ and $[111...11]^{T}$ should be 0. The only possibility for our vector to be 0 is that $\\sum_{i} x_{i}=0$. \n",

    "Well, we know that each node should have a degree of at least k in order to have the graph being k connected, as well as removing k-1 vertices do not disconnect the graph. To get $lambda = 0$, we need to have a constant eigenvector, as showm in Task 1.2.1, but that doesn't show specificlaly that $\\lambda_{0} = ... = \\lambda_{k} = 0$, but only shows that there is at least one lambda being equal to 0. In order to have specifically $\\lambda_{0} = ... = \\lambda_{k} = 0$, but we need to make sure that k of those constant eigenvectors are linearly independent. This can be done by looking locally for each component, where each component do have a number of connections (for example, one component can have 3 connections, meaning degree of 3 and all connected with each other, another can have 2, and so on, until k components). For those, we define eigenvectors [1 1 1] and [1 1] locally (given 3 and 2 connected component). More concrete, if locally looking at the components, we define 1 vectors for those that have the size of the nodes being interconnected locally. Given globally observation where we have n nodes, not only component group number of nodes, we have the same eigenvectors, but we fill the rest of the entries to be 0, having the value globally being $\\lambda = 0$. Since we have now k independent eigenvectors with this procedure, we got $\\lambda_{0} = \\lambda_{1} = ... = \\lambda_{k} = 0$\n",

    "For this exercise, we use Rayleigh Theorem, where we focus on $\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} (x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} = x^{T}Lx$. Given that we have in the new grah $G^{'}$ an edge less than G, we conclude that $x^{T}L'x \\leq x^{T}Lx$ , because  the summation of squared distance between all edges is less or equal (could have been 0 for the original graph G) for the new Graph, given a edge less. Regarding the notebook where $\\lambda_{n} = min_{x \\neq 0} \\frac{m^{T}Mx}{x^{T}x}$ and $\\lambda_{n-1} = min_{x \\neq 0, x^{T}x_{1} = 0} \\frac{x^{T}Mx}{x^{T}x}$ we can addapt it to our laplace L for any lambda i, and get:  $\\lambda_{i} = \\lambda_{n-(n-i)} = min_{x \\neq 0, x^{T}x_{1} , ... , x^{T}x_{n-i}} \\frac{x^{T}Lx}{x^{T}x} $. From this we can conclude that, since x is an arbitrary equivalent vector in both cases, where the only significant difference is the value of the Rayleigh Theorem, where given $x^{T}L'x \\leq x^{T}Lx$, we conclude that, regardless of lambda, $\\lambda_{i}' \\leq \\lambda_{i}$. \n",

    "Is a random walk approach, where you randomly by alpha you go to a random neighbor (even random distribution of which neighbor you are going to), or jump back to start_node. Due to its randomness and the even distribution of random neighbor visit, you get the top-10 nodes changing very much per running the code multiple time.\n",

If you have a low iteration, even if you are the most popular node and have the most amount of connecitons and possibilities to visit as many nodes as possible, you are still restricted to visit a specific amount of neighbors lower than the number of iteration (sinking then going back and because of the 1-alpha jumps). It stabilizes more when running with high number of iterations, but the probabilities can still shifting from the top-10 due to my inital argument. \n",
